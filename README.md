# JavaScript Fundamentals: Scope Lab

## Learning Goals

* Use `const` and `let` to fix the scope in JavaScript

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll need to debug some issues related to function scope in JavaScript: variables might not be what we expect, certain variables might be unavailable, and in general the current code might be a little chaotic.

## Use `const` and `let` to Fix the Scope in JavaScript

Start by running the specs and reading the results, fix some things, run the tests again, and repeat. Using your knowledge of scope, access and change some of these variables.
